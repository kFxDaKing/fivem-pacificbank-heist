You can edit this freely. If you want to share an improved or edited version of this script, just please ask for my permission and credit me.

Altough I'm not sure, changing the folder name may break the script. Just don't change it.

## Installation

- You will need "utk_ornateprops" for this script to work with gold and diamond looting, you can turn it off in "client.lua",

- First add items in your database, you can find the relevant sql file in here,

- After sql make sure you have these scripts installed and working fine:

[ESX](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended)

[mythic_notify](https://github.com/mythicrp/mythic_notify) IMPORTANT INFO: This file name must be "mythic_notify"

or

[pNotify](https://github.com/Nick78111/pNotify) IMPORTANT INFO: This file name must be "pNotify"

[progressBars](https://github.com/torpidity/progressBars/releases/tag/1.0) IMPORTANT INFO: This file name must be "progressBars"

- Then just copy "utk_ornateheist" and "utk_ornateprops" to you resources file and start them from "server.cfg", make sure to start "utk_ornateprops" before the "utk_ornateheist" just in case.

- If you want to use pNotify copy clientpNotify.lua and change its name to client.lua (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!)

## Configuration

- There are a lot of comment lines inside the code for you to understand better, you can disable extraprops(gold, diamond) in "client.lua",

- In "server.lua" also comment lines for you to edit easily.
